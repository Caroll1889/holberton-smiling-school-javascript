# 0x0F. Build a web app in JavaScript
### :open_file_folder: Specializations - Web Stack programming ― Front-end

In this project, you will finalize the previous project [0x0B. Implement a design with bootstrap](https://github.com/Caroll1889/holberton-smiling-school) and make some parts dynamic with Javascript (JQuery exactly).

You will reuse final files of [0x0B. Implement a design with bootstrap](https://github.com/Caroll1889/holberton-smiling-school) and update them.

You will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design/Bootstrap/Javascript knowledges that you learned previously.

You won’t have a lot of instruction, you are free to implement it the way that you want - the objective is simple: Have fully functional web pages that look the same as the designer file.

Here the final result:
